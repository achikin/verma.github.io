I hate writing a ton of text, so I'll get straight to it.

This is Datascript 101, a series of short tutorials that will help me understand and document some of the things I'd like to do with Datascript.  I would assume you're set and ready to go (aka not disucssing installation etc.).

 - Chapter 1.  Initializing and adding records.
 - Chapter 2.  TBD
